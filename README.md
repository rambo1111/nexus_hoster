## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of Nexus Hoster up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher. [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
* **npm**: Included with Node.js.
* **MongoDB Atlas Account**: A free account is sufficient. [Sign up here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nexus-hoster.git](https://github.com/your-username/nexus-hoster.git)
    cd nexus-hoster
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    This project uses specific package versions for compatibility. It is crucial to use the provided `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```
    *Note: The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is required to resolve dependency conflicts between `multer` and `multer-gridfs-storage`.*

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    * Get your MongoDB connection string from your Atlas dashboard.
    * Add the following content to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values:

    ```env
    # .env

    # Your MongoDB connection string (from Atlas)
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster-name.mongodb.net/nexus-db?retryWrites=true&w=majority

    # A long, random, and secret string for signing JWTs
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_string_for_jwt_that_is_long
    ```

4.  **Run the Server**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
